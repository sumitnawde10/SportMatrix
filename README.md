# SportMatrix - AI-Powered Football Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
**SportMatrix** is an **AI-driven sports analytics platform** designed to evaluate and rank **football players and teams** using **machine learning models (TOPSIS + Decision Tree)**. The system provides **data-driven insights** for coaches, analysts, and players by leveraging **real-time performance metrics and predictive modeling**.

## 🎯 Features
- **Player Performance Analysis** → Ranks players based on **individual attributes**.
- **Team Performance Analysis** → Uses **TOPSIS + Decision Tree** to **recommend the best team formations**.
- **Data Normalization & Ranking** → Ensures **fair comparisons** across players.
- **Statistical & ML Models** → Uses **TOPSIS for ranking & Decision Tree for team selection**.
- **Data Visualization** → **Bar charts, scatter plots, & decision tree visualizations**.
- **Real-Time Web Dashboard** → Flask-powered **interactive ranking dashboard**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Chart.js for visualizations)
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning:** TOPSIS (Ranking Players) + **Decision Tree Regressor (Team Selection & Analysis)**
- **Database:** Player stats stored & processed using Pandas DataFrame

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
